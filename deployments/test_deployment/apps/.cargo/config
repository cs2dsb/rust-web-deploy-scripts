# This was added to keep the target dir out of the deployment tree so vagrant doesn't
# end up copying 2gb+ of intermediate artifacts up every provision
# It probably makes more sense to keep the rust source entirely out of the deployment
# folder but I wanted to have a complete example that works out of the box
